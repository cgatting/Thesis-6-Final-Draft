I will enhance the manuscript review section to provide a comprehensive breakdown and deeper analysis as requested.

### 1. Enhanced Analysis Logic (`AnalysisService.ts` & `types.ts`)
*   **Trigger Detection**: I will modify the detection algorithms to capture exactly *which* words or phrases triggered a flag (e.g., "shown that", "lack of").
*   **Detailed Insights**: Instead of generic notes, I will generate specific context-aware explanations (e.g., *"Flagged as a claim requiring evidence due to the phrase 'shown that'."*).
*   **Data Structure**: Update `AnalyzedSentence` to store `triggerPhrase` and more granular `analysisType`.

### 2. "Analysis Overview" Dashboard (`DocumentViewer.tsx`)
*   **New Sidebar View**: When no sentence is selected, I will replace the empty state with a rich **Analysis Breakdown Dashboard**.
*   **Interactive Lists**:
    *   **Missing Citations**: A list of all sentences that need citations, allowing you to click and jump directly to them.
    *   **High Impact Claims**: A highlight reel of the manuscript's most significant statements.
    *   **Research Gaps**: A consolidated list of all identified gaps for easy review.
*   **Detailed Cards**: When a sentence is selected, the analysis card will now show the **Trigger Phrase** and specific **Recommendations** (e.g., "Consider adding a reference here").

### 3. Visual Refinements
*   **Iconography**: Add specific icons for each analysis category (Warning for missing citations, Star for impact, Search for gaps).
*   **Navigation**: Ensure smooth scrolling when clicking items in the new Analysis Overview.

This approach transforms the feature from simple highlighting into a navigable, actionable review tool.
